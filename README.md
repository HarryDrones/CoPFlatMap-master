.# CoPFlatMap
show how circles of equal altitude morph on a map with changes in GHA and altitude as received over USB.
This requires an IMU running Multiwii 2.3 which the com/ stuff needs to communicate to android over USB
using the multiwii serial protocol.

I got my IMU from Readytoflyquads.com for about $20.00
